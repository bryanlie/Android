1. /dev/kvm permission denied

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37300811/android-studio-dev-kvm-device-permission-denied

As mentioned in the comments, starting with Ubuntu 18.04 and Linux Mint Tara you need to first sudo apt install qemu-kvm.

To check the ownership of /dev/kvm use

ls -al /dev/kvm

The user was root, the group kvm. To check which users are in the kvm group, use

grep kvm /etc/group

This returned

kvm:x:some_number:

on my system: as there is nothing rightwards of the final :, there are no users in the kvm group.

To add your user to the kvm group, you could use

sudo adduser $USER kvm

which adds the user to the group, and check once again with grep kvm /etc/group. 

This is how I got it to work in Ubuntu 18.04

sudo apt install qemu-kvm

Add your user to kvm group using:

sudo adduser <Replace with username> kvm

If still showing permission denied:

sudo chown <Replace with username> /dev/kvm
